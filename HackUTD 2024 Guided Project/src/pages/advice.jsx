            For Smart Appliances, Home Security, or Home Surveillance consider
            checking out the following :
          </h1>

          <h4>Signal Strength:</h4>
          <h5>
            Ensure the appliance is within a reasonable range of your router.
            Signal strength diminishes with distance or physical
            obstructions.Avoid placing the router near other electronics or
            appliances that can interfere with Wi-Fi signals, such as
            microwaves.
          </h5>

          <h4>Restart Your Router and Devices:</h4>
          <h5>
            Turn off your router and smart appliance for about 10 seconds, then
            turn them back on. This can often resolve temporary connection
            issues.
          </h5>

          <h4>Switch to 2.4GHz Network:</h4>
          <h5>
            Many smart devices are optimized for 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi networks rather
            than 5 GHz due to its longer range. Check your router settings and
            connect the device to the 2.4 GHz network if available.
          </h5>

          <h4>Reduce Network Congestion:</h4>
          <h5>
            Disconnect devices that arenâ€™t in use from the network. Too many
            devices connected simultaneously can slow down the connection.

            Most routers have a diagnostic tool accessible via their admin
            panel.
          </h5>

          <h4>Update Firmware:</h4>
          <h5>
            Log into your router's admin interface and check for firmware
            updates.
          </h5>

          <h4>Inspect Hardware:</h4>

            For concerns related to Internet Speed, Device Count, Security, or
            Lack of Perks, consider the following:
          </h1>
          <h4>Internet Speed:</h4>
          <h5>
            Test your speed using an online speed test tool to confirm your
            current internet performance. Consider upgrading your plan if your
            current speed doesn't meet your needs, especially with multiple
            users or devices.
          </h5>

          <h4>Device Count:</h4>
          <h5>
            Check how many devices are connected to your network. If you have
            more than 25 devices, disconnect unused devices to free up network
            bandwidth. Upgrade to the latest generation WiFi Router or consider
            adding more extenders. Specific Product Reccomendations: Whole-Home
            Wi-Fi
          </h5>

          <h4>Security:</h4>
          <h5>
            Ensure your Wi-Fi network is secured with WPA3 or WPA2 encryption.
            Change your router's default admin password to prevent unauthorized
            access.
          </h5>

          <h4>Lack of Perks:</h4>
          <h5>
            Explore value-added services offered by your provider, such as
            enhanced security, parental controls, or streaming bundles. Consider
            switching to a provider that includes perks like free equipment
            upgrades or discounts on other services.
