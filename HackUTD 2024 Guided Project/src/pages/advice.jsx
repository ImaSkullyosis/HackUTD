          <strong>Signal Strength:</strong> 
          <ul>

          </ul>
          Ensure the appliance is within a reasonable range of
          your router. Signal strength diminishes with distance or physical
          obstructions.Avoid placing the router near other electronics or
          appliances that can interfere with Wi-Fi signals, such as microwaves.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Restart Your Router and Devices:</strong> 
          <ul>
          Turn off your router and smart
          appliance for about 10 seconds, then turn them back on. This can often
          resolve temporary connection issues.
          </ul>
          
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Switch to 2.4GHz Network:</strong> 
          <ul>
          Many smart devices are optimized for 2.4 GHz
          Wi-Fi networks rather than 5 GHz due to its longer range. Check your
          router settings and connect the device to the 2.4 GHz network if
          available.

        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Reduce Network Congestion:</strong> 
          <ul>
          Disconnect devices that arenâ€™t in use from
          the network. Too many devices connected simultaneously can slow down
          the connection.

            Check how many devices are connected to your network. If you have more than 25 devices, disconnect unused devices to free up network bandwidth.
            Upgrade to the latest generation WiFi Router or consider adding more extenders.
