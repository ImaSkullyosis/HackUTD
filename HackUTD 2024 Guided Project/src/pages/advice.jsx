          For Smart Appliances, Home Security, or Home Surveillance consider
          checking out the following :{" "}
        </div>
        <div>
          Signal Strength: Ensure the appliance is within a reasonable range of
          your router. Signal strength diminishes with distance or physical
          obstructions.Avoid placing the router near other electronics or
          appliances that can interfere with Wi-Fi signals, such as microwaves.
        </div>
        <div>
          Restart Your Router and Devices: Turn off your router and smart
          appliance for about 10 seconds, then turn them back on. This can often
          resolve temporary connection issues.
        </div>
        <div>
          Switch to 2.4GHz Network: Many smart devices are optimized for 2.4 GHz
          Wi-Fi networks rather than 5 GHz due to its longer range. Check your
          router settings and connect the device to the 2.4 GHz network if
          available.
        </div>
        <div>
          Reduce Network Congestion: Disconnect devices that arenâ€™t in use from
          the network. Too many devices connected simultaneously can slow down
          the connection.

      <div>
        Update Firmware: Log into your router's admin interface and check for
